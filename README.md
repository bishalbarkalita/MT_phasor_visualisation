This is a bunch of codes to visualise the phase tensor ellipse of magnetotelluric data. The user need to upload the file of the magnetotelluric data. The file should be in the .dat format.
Once the file is uploaded the user need to run the program to get the output.
More information on the magnetotelluric phase tensor can be found on the article Caldwell, T.G., Bibby, H.M. and Brown, C. (2004). The magnetotelluric phase tensor.
